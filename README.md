# Stock Market Prediction Using LSTM

## Basics
This repository uses data acquired from the NASDAQ site, where the trends in
stocks are updated daily, to predict the stock prices in the upcoming days. The
repository uses a Microsoft edge web driver that in turn downloads the correct
data from the url without the user having to worry about any of it(WOrks only on
windows for now sadly...) Just sit
back and choose from the list of trending stocks and update your knowledge
regarding the correct stocks as well.
The program plots the data into graphs for better nderstanding of the user.

## Long Short Term Memory Algorithm 
The project uses LSTM algorithm to predict the stock prices in the upcoming
days. Long Short Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” – are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies. They were introduced by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997), and were refined and popularized by many people in following work.1 They work tremendously well on a large variety of problems, and are now widely used.

LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem. Remembering information for long periods of time is practically their default behavior, not something they struggle to learn!
